# CPU-S Simulator ðŸ’»

Welcome to the CPU-S Simulator! ðŸŽ‰ This project simulates a simple example CPU, built using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

CPU-S has a memory of 16 data variables of 8 bits each and 16 instructions of 7 bits each (3 bits for the instruction and 4 bits for an address). It is capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and conditional jumps. ðŸ¤–

To use the simulator, simply go to the website and start inputting instructions. You can see the output of each instruction as it is executed by the CPU. ðŸ’»

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. ðŸ’¬ I'd love to hear from you! ðŸŽ¤
